DELETE HEREDOC FILES






Can i just parse everything in a fork and then pass the tree through a pipe?
This would just make my life so much easier...




Every time somthing fails etc... even while parsing... i need to add the error to env.

SYNTAX
* Remove "\" if its not in quotes


CLEANING
* Redir nodes have the file name allocated as a string - must free when cleaning
